intro: Where I do more familiarizing with all the things on the camera
---

So much stuff in this thing. What are all the buttons and knobs? What are they
called? What can you do with them?

## At the top of the camera

Function 1 button to the right of the On/Off switch. (The un-labeled one.) It
turns face detection on and off.

The exposure compensation dial is right next to it. This is for when you want
to over-expose or under-expose your photos.

The big dial towards the center is the shutter speed, and ISO dial. More on
this soon ... because I admit that I have a lot to learn.

The "hot shoe" is where you can place your external flash (The light. Not the
memory.)

## At the front of the camera

* Front command dial.
* The "function two" button which brings up a menu that allows you to loop
  through common settings with the control ring while you are shooting. Eg:
  cycling through different "film simulations" you can choose (sepia, black and
  white, etc).
* Around the function two button is a little toggle where you can switch
  between your optical viewfinder and your electrical viewfinder.
* Between the control ring and the body is the aperture ring.
* At the very front is where you can attach filters by unscrewing the very tip,
  or front of the lense, and placing your filter attachment and filter. Like
  the Moment Cinebloom filter, as mentioned in the video.

## To the left of the camera

The focus mode switch where you can select "manual focus", which turns your
control ring on to focus your shot, well ... manually. Clicking on the dial in
the back of the camera, at the top and on the right, to zoom in.

"Continuous" is great for when you're shooting moving objects.

"Single" is better for shooting things like portraits.

## The back of the camera

The viewfinder and the diopter immediately to the left where you can adjust the
focus of the viewfinder. Immediately to the right is the sensor that will turn
the screen off if you're placing your eye up to the viewfinder.

The "Drive/Delete" button which will display the menu to switch between
different shooting modes - most common for selecting whether you're in "Still
Image" or "Movie" modes.

"AEL / AFL" button, is the exposure and focus lock button.

The rear command dial to the furthest right at the top controls the shutter
speed.

The little "Q" button on the edge of the back, on the right side, is the "quick
menu button". This gives you quick access to different settings so you don't
have to dig through all the different deep menu settings. You use the little
joystick to move around to the different quick menu items and then cycle
through each of them with the rear command dial.
