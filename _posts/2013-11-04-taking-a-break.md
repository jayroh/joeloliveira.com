There are, I'm sure, people wondering why on earth I would leave a job like
the one I've had for 18 months at thoughtbot. For a little while I thought the
same thing.

Smart people around me every day.
Good salary.
Security.
Opportunities around every corner.
Perks to being a "thoughtbotter" (there are plenty).

Those barely scratch the surface as there are more. I'm going to miss working
there -- a *lot*.

But why leave? The answer is the most logical and straightfoward - the right
opportunity came along to work with a smart and ambitious group of people
that will allow me the privilege of making a huge contribution to a product I
want to not only see built, but I want to use.

For the first time in 14 years I won't be in the services business, which will
be strange for sure. I've been working with clients so long and had gotten to
the point where I was really starting to *get it* and hone that part of my
craft. The fact that it had taken me so long to consciously and actively wrap
my head around that part could be argued as a "smell".

"Why did it take you so long?"

It's a great question. I hope to dig into my brain and tease out the reasons
why soon. I have some thoughts on the matter.

The next 4-8 weeks will be spent taking the opportunity to play
dendrochronologist and examine the rings in the cross-section of my career, and
my adult life. What are the motivations and behavior that have gotten me here?

We'll see! Perhaps together.
