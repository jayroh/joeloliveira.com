For [nearly nine years], Shubox has been a part of my life. It started as
a passion project --- a SaaS product that I dreamed might one day stand
on its own. At the time, *success*, to me, meant autonomy. The more users,
more revenue, the more viability, meant that maybe it could replace my 
day job. That was the vision.

(Does that story sound familiar? Work a full time job? Create a side-hustle 
that pops, concentrate on that full-time? Yes. It does sound familiar.)

But over time, my definition of success evolved. These days, success
looks a lot more like balance: meaningful work at my full-time job, more
time with my family, and projects that bring me energy rather than drain
it. In that light, keeping Shubox running just didn't fit anymore. This
is why I made the decision to send an email out last week to customers,
colleagues, friends, supporters, and advisors, that I would be shutting
it down by the end of the year. Emails have been sent out. People have
been notified. I will start the 3 month process of shutting all moving
parts down.

It wasn't a single dramatic event that led me here, but rather a quiet
repetition: the voice in my head saying, "I should really work on Shubox." 
I heard it one (maybe ten) too many times, often when I'd rather be fully
present with my family. That's when it clicked --- instead of energizing
me, Shubox had become a weight.

I'd had some conversations with friends about it (shout-out to [Ben] who 
in a catch-up conversation made me think really hard about this). 
Additionally, my CPA would, like clockwork, remind me every year that we 
*could* wind down all corporate considerations to make the yearly conversation 
reduce by one (shout-out Peter! üêêÔ∏è). The thought had been bouncing around 
in there for a while and when met with the experience above, I think I knew 
it was time. 

The decision to walk away from Shubox has also changed how I think about 
these personal projects. What is "success"? Success isn't just about longevity 
or profitability or autonomy. It's about how well a project will fit into my 
life and whether it adds more than it takes. A successful side project might 
be small, fun, and light --- not necessarily something that has to "make it big."

I don't think anyone would ask _me_ for advice. But, if you're wrestling with 
whether to shut down a project of your own, here's what I'd say:

- Listen to that inner voice; it's usually telling you the truth.
- Don't measure yourself against other people's expectations. Only you know whether a project is worth your time.
- Letting go doesn't mean failure. Sometimes it's the most thoughtful, mature decision you can make.
- You're not giving up on creativity; you're just making space for projects that actually fit your life.

In closing, Shubox will always mean a lot to me. It taught me about building,
maintaining, and, eventually, ***letting go***. More importantly, [it taught me 
about myself]. While Shubox is coming to an end, my creativity and my desire 
to build isn't. It's just shifting into something lighter, more sustainable, 
and more aligned with where I am today. I'm sure I'll have something else to
share in the not too distant future.
