I noticed that this week marked the 6 month mark since I started working with [Alexa](https://www.instagram.com/alexammay/), my trainer via [All-Tru Health and Performance](https://www.instagram.com/alltru_hp/). The main reason I took notice? I saw in the [Trainerize](https://www.trainerize.com/) app that Thursday was the 100th workout since the beginning of December. For those gym-rats among us, that's no big deal. For me - it's a big deal!

* One hundred intense workouts - a mix of HIIT, dumbbells, body-weight.
* Between 16-17 workouts a month.
* About 4 times a week.
* Paired with a 1750-2000 calorie, 40/20/40 carb/fat/protein macro.

That's a level of commitment to physical activity I've never previously achieved, so you could say I'm a little proud of myself.

After 6 months the results have been excellent â€“ I've dropped 25 lbs of fat, put on 10 lbs of muscle, and, most importantly, I feel quite good. There's much more I could say but I'm going to save that for after the next 6 months. This is only the start.

(One note: big ups to [Alexa](https://www.instagram.com/alexammay/) for keeping me on point for the last 6 months. She's been the steadying and encouraging force I've needed.)
