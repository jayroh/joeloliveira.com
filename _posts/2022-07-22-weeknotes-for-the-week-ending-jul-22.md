Most weekday mornings I will walk G to the bus stop near Brookline High School
for his trip to his day camp. We're out the door at around 7:53AM and arriving just
about at 8:00AM. The past week or so has been brutally hot so if I was going to get
any time outside it's going to be right after his drop-off. I'm not built for that
90+ degree stuff.

Thankfully, luckily, our town is pretty well stocked with parks and areas to walk
in the shade. Shade is at a premium with this heat so I kept walking until I found
a nice spot to take a break, and in this case, have a coffee. [Brothers and
Sisters](https://www.brothersandsistersco.com/) (formerly [the KooKoo Cafe](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g60823-d926097-Reviews-Kookoo_Cafe-Brookline_Massachusetts.html)) in the Village has been that little oasis
thanks to the decent cold-brew, and copious seating &amp; shade just outside.

Don't know if it's necessarily a spot to make the trip for, but for me it's been
a welcome break and spot to get my brain to slow down a bit.

lamenting the redesign of his website.

The [comments at HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32179563)
are, predictably, ludicrous, but I digress.

Having lived on the Agency side of this equation for a large hunk of my career
there is a lot here that rings familiar and true. As I look back on those days,
my freelancing days, I realize how profoundly underestimated and under-served
the customer engagement and management portion of the equation is. I can look
back and clearly pick out the spots where I done F'd up and wish I was more
mature and better at that part of the job. Live and learn.
