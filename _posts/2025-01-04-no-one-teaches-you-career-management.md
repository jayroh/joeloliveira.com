## Preface

When I say "no one teaches you", I mean that there are life lessons that are
not among the typical curriculum provided to young adults as they begin
navigating their *ADULT* adult lives. Not from their schools, their first jobs,
and not from their parents. This post is a reflection on life
lessons you may have to learn the hard way - like I did.

***

No one is paying attention to you at work. (Like, *really* seeing you perform
at that high level.)

Well, mostly. Maybe if you’re some [wunderkind]? Or 10x unicorn? Maybe.

But no, mostly. Nope.

Sorry.

Why? Because everyone is also trying to make their way, get by, keep their
head above water, or get to the end of the day or week. Being an adult is hard,
and most of us are just tired.

Of course there are always exceptions to the rule. People around you may care,
and may be trying to do what they can to help you excel and get that promotion,
but at the end of the day that responsibility ends up at your feet. The
responsibility to prove that you are doing everything you need to do to move up
that ladder, is ultimately on you.

Now, here’s where some of those exceptions kick in - if you’re lucky, you work
at a company that has a tried and true process for showcasing the impact you
have delivered to the business. Perhaps that’s a set of documents that serve as
a framework for advancement, or the company uses something like [Lattice] to good
effect, or your manager is constantly on your ass to document everything. But
that’s a lot o’ “buts” and “maybes”.

**But** … most don’t.

So don’t expect that the people in charge of making decisions will *just know*.
They won’t.[^1]

With that cynicism laced with realism&mdash;or vice-versa&mdash;out of the way,
what now?

Keep receipts. Document what you’ve delivered month-over-month. What were your
personal initiatives? Where have you delivered against your goals and promises?
Who have you helped improve, and are you able to state how and why? Be direct
on what you intend to do. What are your plans? Look at your organization’s
leveling rubrics and not only track where you meet the expectations, but can
exhibit how you have internalized those skills and have burned into muscle
memory.

I want to be clear on something - I suck at this! I am often so focused on the
day and week at hand, that I neglect to suitably prioritize the documentation
of slow and steady growth. This is as much a reminder for me as it is for
anyone I might have a similar conversation with. I wish I'd more people in my
orbit over the years to beat this into my brain. Alas, I did not. C'est la vie.
(Again, not their problem.)

So if you’re reading this, consider the above. Good luck. Look out for #1.
Keep your receipts. And [let me know how it goes].

[^1]: I worked at this consultancy several lifetimes ago. I was doing good work (as far as I knew) and had several people telling me as much. The challenge at the time was that the department we were in skewed more towards the design/IA/UX side of work at a digital agency, but as a specialist in front-end technology I, and others, were on the fringes and met with an apples vs. oranges, compare-and-contrast, problem. I was not equipped at that time to make the case for myself and outline where my *personal* value and the role's trajectory (from a larger digital evolutionary perspective) was. My memory recalls that I eventually *did* get that promotion, but the glacial turn towards getting there burned me out enough to leave when I could. To be clear, most of that was a product of my inaction and the inability to realize this.
