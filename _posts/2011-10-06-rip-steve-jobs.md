I started writing this over at Hacker News and figured I would re-post it here.

I, just now, walked into my home office after a trip to my doctor for a check-up … a check-up I’d been putting off for 2 years or so. The timing is impeccable with what happened yesterday in Mr. Jobs’ passing. Health and my personal well-being have never been more important to me than it is now. I have lost a little over 50 pounds in the last 6 months because, well, I couldn’t ignore my health problems any longer. It got to be increasingly important that I pay attention.

Other than the weight, what else have I lost? My sister, Anna. She was 36 years old. Anna died from a pulmonary embolism while she was getting ready to go to work as an ICU nurse. Ironically, she was a nurse who rarely (if ever) saw a doctor and ended up passing away because she didn’t know she was prone to easy blood clotting. I miss her tremendously, as a human being and a true beautiful spirit, more than I can write here. She was way way greater than the sum of her parts.

If that type of profound loss is not a wake up call, I don’t know what is.

Why will I miss Steve Jobs, the icon — a man that I’ve never met? Not the iphones and macbooks and ipads that I’ve bought and enjoyed immensely – but [the lesson that tomorrow is no sure thing and to live today as if it’s not][1]. This particular lesson is what I’ll always remember about this man. He helped us get all of this wonderful STUFF, purchased with money, but the journey that got Apple there is entirely without a price tag. So no, I won’t miss Steve Jobs, “the man” like I’ll miss Anna. I will remember his legacy for what it provided me – the reminder to always stay foolish, always stay hungry.

While reflecting on things related to loss I’ve learned how important it is to hug your family members – tell them how much you love them. Next, tell them to literally take care of themselves – both physically and spiritually. You and I want them around, and happy, for as long as possible.
