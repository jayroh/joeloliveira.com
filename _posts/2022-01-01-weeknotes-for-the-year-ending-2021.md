Wellp. Another one in the books.

Instead of regaling you with all of the awful things that happened in 2021 let's take a look back on one specific thing that made me happy this year. Let's consider something truly remarkable - the move from our tiny condo, our home of 13 years, into our (more) spacious new home around the corner. Specifically, the room I occupy for most of my time during working hours, my office.

Before
------

This room was all wood. Everywhere you looked. Wood. And shelves. So much shelving. SHELVES! Did I mention "shelves"?

This had to be just a guest room for the previous owners. The only thing that'd fit, other than shelves full of books, is a bed. I mean, I _could_ have kept everything as-is, bought a lounge chair, a smoking jacket, a wet bar, and a collection of bourbon and ... shit. I may have made a mistake.

In any case. I tore everything down to the studs and made this room into my office. After a year of working in a kitchen next to a refrigerator clanging, vibrating, and humming during all of my zoom calls, it was nigh time I had a space to myself. Praise the gods - my own space.

My requirements for this space were pretty simple:

* Ample desk space
* A couch (it took a while, but I'm happy with the purchase from Joybird, a pull-out couch that my mother is much happier to use than the blow-up mattress)
* The spot for TV, stereo, video games, and network equipment storage.

Mission accomplished.

I must say that the process was rewarding and fun. I managed to do all of the demo myself, and wire things up as I wanted -- cat6/RJ45 drops, speaker wires/banana plug wall plates -- before the electrician and contractors tidied and closed everything up. It took a while, but once everything was done there was a clear and profound feeling of satisfaction.

I attempted to take some photos from the same angles as the photos above, so here's how everything looks as of this weekend.

Some of the walls are still a bit bare and need some attention but for the time being things feel pretty cozy.

Misc.
-----

* Reading: Started [Bubbleball] by Ben Golliver. Needing a bit of a palate-cleanser after a string of Fiction.
* Listening: [Begin the New Year by Reflecting on These 3 Life-Changing Questions] from the [Art of Manliness] podcast. Gratitude meditation is something I'm familiar with but this podcast opens things up through a bit of a different perspective, specifically the [Naikan] method of self-reflection.
* Watching: [The Lost Daughter], a film by Maggie Gyllenhaal - her directorial debut. There's a lot to like in this, but ultimately left a bit to be desired. Olivia Colman remains one of the most compelling actors in the game today. There's nothing she's in where she's not objectively _great_. Love her.

One More Thingâ„¢
---------------

If we're reflecting on 2021, I can't neglect to mention how things turned out for our son. It wasn't the best, but it was a much better year for G than 2020. In March, a year to the day that the pandemic shut everything down, he started attending K in person. The experience of being IN a school, with OTHER children, doing KID things, was an overwhelmingly positive shift from the previous year. The summer saw us spending time on the Cape quite a bit, where he spent every moment he could swimming in his Grandparents' new pool. He began the summer as a minnow, and emerged a marlin. We ended the year with him being fully vaccinated (celebrated with a trip to see _Spider-Man: No Way Home_), and in the throes of his own personal *Pokemon Mania*. We begin 2022 on the verge of his turning 7 years old. All of these things are matters of fact, yes - but the most important of which is that he remains a sweet, sensitive, smart, funny, and loving little boy. The ups and downs of the year remain, but if all we have is his laugh and magnetic personality, then it was a great, _great_ year.
