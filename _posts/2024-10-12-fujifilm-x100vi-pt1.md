intro: Where I get familiar with a new camera

# Stills or Video

Changing the context of how you're shooting. Always change the settings for still shots
by turning the camera on, pressing `Drive/Delete` and scrolling and selecting "Still Image", versus scrolling all the way down to the bottom and selecting "Movie".

You *are* able to change video settings while still in "Still Image" mode, but there are different options and settings within the "still image" context that you can change or further update in the "Movie" context.

As a result, always change the settings for either where it is best applied.

# Still Images: Miscellaneous Settings

When going through all of the configuration options, there are some things I found to be unintuitive. For example:

1. Under "AF/MF" (Auto-focus / Manual Focus) there are some things that will be grayed out, or unable to be changed. This may be depending on the focus mode setting on the left side of the camera body - "M, C, S". You will have some things available if you are in "Manual", or "Continuous", or "Single" focus modes.

2. "AF+MF" - when turned on, will auto-focus first, then allow you to manually focus after the auto-focus is done.

3. "MF Assist", set it to "peak", with "focus peak highlight" set to "RED(HIGH)". This will highlight the areas of the subject in focus within the lcd with red, well, highlight. When using the manual focus dial this will provide you a better idea of what is being focused on.

# Videos: Miscellaneous Settings

1. "Movie Settings" / "IS Mode Boost": Good to turn this "On" if you are shooting video, and holding the camera still in your hands. If you don't have a tripod and it is _not_ being held perfectly still, turn this setting on.
