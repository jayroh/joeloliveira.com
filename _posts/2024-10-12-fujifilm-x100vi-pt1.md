I bought a new camera.

Earlier in the year there were a glut of videos on social media about this new
Fujifilm X100VI camera that people were freaking out about. I fell down into
the rabbit hole, read many reviews, and watched my fair share of videos. Having
walked around a little bit with a Nikon DSLR many years ago, something about
the size of this little camera paired with the features struck a chord. At that
time I thought, "I must have this". The issue upon completing said thought was
that this camera, unless you pre-ordered at the moment of its announcement,
would remain on back-order for months.

Undeterred, I placed my order. And I waited.

That was 7 months ago.

...

Last weekend it came in.

## Ok. How do I use this thing?

Because, the answer to which, is - I haven't the foggiest.

Buttons, knobs, dials, switches, gestures. Derp?

I guess I'll have to figure it out the same way everyone else figures
anything out - by watching YouTube videos. Oh - and for me - by taking
notes. So, here's where I'll be posting some associated YouTube videos, along
with anything I find noteworthy enough (for me) for future recall. If you find
this helpful, that's great. If not, that's also great.

## Stills or Video

Changing the context of how you're shooting. Always change the settings for
still shots by turning the camera on, pressing `Drive/Delete` and scrolling and
selecting "Still Image", versus scrolling all the way down to the bottom and
selecting "Movie".

You *are* able to change video settings while still in "Still Image" mode, but
there are different options and settings within the "still image" context that
you can change or further update in the "Movie" context.

As a result, always change the settings for either where it is best applied.

## Still Images: Miscellaneous Settings

When going through all of the configuration options, there are some things I
found to be unintuitive. For example:

1. Under "AF/MF" (Auto-focus / Manual Focus) there are some things that will be
   grayed out, or unable to be changed. This may be depending on the focus mode
   setting on the left side of the camera body - "M, C, S". You will have some
   things available if you are in "Manual", or "Continuous", or "Single" focus
   modes.
2. "AF+MF" - when turned on, will auto-focus first, then allow you to manually
   focus after the auto-focus is done.
3. "MF Assist", set it to "peak", with "focus peak highlight" set to
   "RED(HIGH)". This will highlight the areas of the subject in focus within
   the lcd with red, well, highlight. When using the manual focus dial this will
   provide you a better idea of what is being focused on.

## Videos: Miscellaneous Settings

1. "Movie Settings" / "IS Mode Boost": Good to turn this "On" if you are
   shooting video, and holding the camera still in your hands. If you don't
   *have* a tripod and it is  being held perfectly still, turn this setting on.

## Items for Future Research

* Film Simulation - the different "looks" and styles you can choose, when
  you're shooting
* Auto-focus settings and usage
* Shortcuts
