I'll get right into it - 2015 was a good year. And, there's no way around this, it was because of
the birth of my son, Grayson.

That's pretty much it. That's the TLDR version of our year.

### The Longer Version

There isn't a single event in the 38 years of my life that has had as profound an effect on my day
to day life as the birth of this child. Most things people tell you &ndash; "There's you the day
before, there's you the day after, they're night and day", etc &ndash; that's certainly true. You
can't escape that. There are other adages that are a little less universally true ("It was the
greatest day of my life!" ... actually, it was stressful), but we're all our own people, right? In
any case, the incredible evolution in me personally has been this incredible shift philosophically
where I can now consider the path in front of my son to be a clean slate. I no longer mull over what
happened before, as that is history writ, instead I can concentrate moving forward on the wonderful
future we, he, I, have ahead of us. My enthusiasm for *this* new year is unlike almost all before.

### Elsewhere

Knowing that Sara and I were expecting Gray to join us I started 2015 with a bit of a resolve to
work on a few things personally and emotionally. I can look back on the year and consider them a
success as I feel better now than I did a year ago. My motivation this year was to work on some base
fundamental parts of me that I had unintentionally neglected - my mind, my emotional state, my inner
self. I guess the preparation for a baby had the cliche'd existential effect.

Of the behavioral changes I attempted the three that were most beneficial were, first, to see a
therapist semi-regularly. I cannot recommend that, in particular, enough. Find someone you trust and
can establish a healthy rapport with and see them once every other week, or once a month, or as
often as you need. As complicated human beings sometimes the best medicine is to externalize and
talk things out. Clarity has come to me more often than not by the time my 45 minutes is up.

The second is meditation. My practice is admittedly pretty sporadic and would probably not stand up
to scrutiny of being called "practice". But of the times I notice that I need the time to stop and
reflect, I spend 15 minutes with some guided meditation, either with [headspace][] app, or my former
company's app with [Dan Harris][] and [Joseph Goldstein][]- [10% Happier][] To call it effective,
for me, would be a vast understatement. If you're wondering about it and think dipping your toes in
with a bit of a skeptical bent is necessary I would *highly* recommend reading Dan's book of the
same name *"[10% Happier][]"*. It's easily up there with my other favorite books of 2015.

Lastly, writing for myself. Writing for the public&mdash;as you can very well see elsewhere in this
site&mdash;isn't my strongest suit. Writing for myself, to myself, when I need to let some thoughts
out has been therapeutic. I've been using an app called [Day One][] on both my laptop and my phone
to keep these thoughts together in one place, synced, and at the tip of my fingers whenever the need
strikes. I've been on the train riding home from work, struggling with something or other, and the
time I take to write via stream of consciousness has been wonderful as a means of getting things off
my chest. It's a more personal form of self therapy. I know no one else will see it (ha - false
security much?) so I can get out whatever is on my mind. I highly recommend providing yourself an
outlet to accomplish this.

Some of those may help you, some of them may not, most of them may not &ndash; but that's ok. There
is no perscriptive for life and nothing works for everyone. If you're reading this and feel
similarly I recommend exploring your options and, above all, be honest with, and kind *to*,
yourself.

### Furthermore

The clean slate metaphor applies in a few other facets of my life. I have recently, as of
Thanksgiving, left my job at a small startup and spent most of December working exclusively on a
project I've been chipping away at for months. I'm really excited about it and I'll be writing more
about it here soon. I'll leave that for its own post, for now. I'm having conversations with friends
and colleagues and looking forward to, most likely, some time contracting and freelancing. If you're
interested in chatting (please, no full time inquiries) email or tweet at me.

Happy new year!
