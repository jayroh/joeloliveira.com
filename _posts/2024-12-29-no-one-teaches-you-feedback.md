## Preface

When I say "no one teaches you", I mean that there are life lessons that are
not among the typical curriculum provided to young adults as they begin
navigating their *ADULT* adult lives. Not from their schools, their first jobs,
and not from their parents. This post is a reflection on life
lessons you may have to learn the hard way - like I did.

***

When I graduated high school I decided to stay relatively close to home and
attend the University of Hartford, a medium-sized liberal arts school in CT
known for their arts programs. Theater, ballet, music, illustration, art
history, graphic design - all well represented by the programs at UHA. That
first year I chose my major, art with a concentration on illustration. I spent
most of it in art history classes and foundational 100 level classes, figure
drawing and the like. I enjoyed some of it[^1]. However, I quickly ran into
something that would put a hard stop to my dreams of drawing superheroes for
Marvel or DC[^2].

"Crits". Critiques. Criticism.

I couldn’t do it. Could not handle it. (I was a sensitive kid[^3].) After so
many years of people complimenting my doodles, my art class projects, the comic
strips for the school paper, I was just not ready for the heavy dose of *real*
criticism.

## Reframing Criticism

Looking back now, I wonder what would have happened if I’d had the proper
framing&mdash;the framing that “criticism” was a coaching device, not a vessel
for insult and derision[^4]. If I had known these professors were there to
break things down in order to rebuild better and bolder, would I have stayed?
Perhaps.

And therein lies a lesson: *knowing the intent behind the feedback matters.*

When we understand the why behind feedback, it transforms how we process and
respond to it. In hindsight, I see that feedback is not inherently
negative&mdash;it’s a tool for growth.

## Feedback: The 3 Types and 2 Sides

Feedback comes in several forms, [three that I know of]:

1. **Coaching:** Guidance to help you improve.
2. **Evaluation:** Assessing your performance against a standard.
3. **Appreciation:** Recognition for your efforts or achievements.

There are also two sides to the feedback equation: *giving* and *receiving*.
Both are emotional intelligence (EQ) skills that require training and practice.

To *give effective feedback*, ask yourself:

* Do you understand where the receiver is emotionally or mentally?
* Have you considered how they prefer to receive feedback?
* Do you know the context in which they like to receive praise or guidance?

To receive feedback effectively, reflect on the following:

* What is the intent or motivation of the giver?
* Can you temporarily set aside your ego or pride and compartmentalize?
* Can you resist the urge to respond defensively and instead focus on
  understanding the “why”?

## How to Build Your Feedback Skills

How might you work on these things? The book “[Thanks for the Feedback]”
is an excellent resource for examining these things. I would recommend it to
anyone navigating a career in the corporate space. (Not to mention spouses.
*And* parents.) There’s much to learn in there that often no one will take the
time to explain or examine with you[^5].
I am grateful that the managers and peers at my day-job had us read this as
part of a work book club. It has been **immensely** helpful.

## A Reflection on Art School and Beyond

Thinking back, I have wondered how my time in art school would have differed if
I’d been better equipped. What would my career trajectory look like? With the
crystal clear 20/20 hindsight I’m not too broken up that things went the way
they did. It all worked out *pretty okay* in the end.

[^1]: At that time, if we're talking "take it, or leave it" - the art history part I’d put in the “leave it” bucket, certainly not “take it”. My professor was dreadfully boring, the lectures were huge, and my ADD was having absolutely *none* of it. Although, I guess, I do still know what [doric columns], [flying buttresses], and the [Venus of Willendorf] are.
[^2]: Or [Image]. Or [Valiant]. This was the 90’s after all.
[^3]: Still am, just equipped with better coping mechanisms.
[^4]: To be fair, some of the professors absolutely *did* take joy in ripping things to shreds. Cruel? Maybe. (Probably.) But the emotional callouses may serve as armor in what is ostensibly a cruel world.
[^5]: An extra tidbit: if you have done some examination of the self and know how you prefer to give and receive feedback, tell people! Write a [personal README]! Share it with your manager and teammates! Wouldn’t it be helpful to tell people up front the cheat codes on how to work with you? For me, it’s been a tremendous help.
