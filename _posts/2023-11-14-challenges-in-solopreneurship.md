Nine years ago, I embarked on a journey with [Shubox](https://shubox.io), a
solution to simplify uploading to, and working with, Amazon's S3. This venture
not only evolved along with my career but offered rich lessons worth sharing. In
addition to my day job, I work on it my nights and weekends. This is some
background information for the basis of a story I've participated and observed
throughout my career.

The story looks a little like:

1.  You move on from full-time software engineering employment.
2.  Hang a shingle out your door, advertising your new, independent contracting/consulting business.
3.  Work with great clients, get paid (well). Make ends meet.
4.  Leave enough time for yourself to build your own product, perhaps launch your own SaaS.
5.  ...?
6.  Make enough money off your SaaS to devote 100% of your time to that product.

I've done this and currently remain at step #5. I've known **many**
colleagues and friends who've also done this. The ratio of people who get to
step 5 and never manage to see step 6 is, most likely, in the 98%
range<sup>[<a href="#foot-1" name="source-1">2</a>]</sup>. It should go without
saying that this particular hustle is way *way* more difficult than we
would want or expect. I guess if it were different, we'd have every tech-hub
over-populated by wealthy, bootstrapped, side-hustle-preneurs.

Would I discourage anyone from following this path? No, absolutely not. The
likelihood they catch the right wave is slim, but the probability they learn an
extraordinary amount is high. If learning is *a* goal, then you are inherently
set up to succeed. With that, here are some of the things *I've* learned along
the way while building [Shubox](https://shubox.io).

## Being "Solo"

I started [Shubox](https://shubox.io) because I saw a problem (uploading files
from your website to S3) more than several times that grew to an "itch" that
compelled me to "scratch". Why was there nothing better? Surely there was
something to fill my requirements that took less time to wire together? After
building the POC I was convinced I was onto something. This was *now* doing what
I wanted!

Building something you are so certain the world needs - that feeling is
intoxicating. "The world needs this! I can't believe this doesn't exist! It'll
sell itself!" ...Maybe? Coding it is just the beginning. A semi-functional POC
will get you only so far. What about design? Marketing? Product management?
Social engagement? User research?

In addition to being a strong engineer, if you are equally skilled in any of
the above, you are fortunate. I'll tell you what? I am not. So let's talk about
being "solo". When it's just you, you are *all* of those functions. If you
can't, or don't want to, fake it, then you're going to pay for it. Literally.
Even so, that is a singular transaction. Those partners will only be around for
so long. What happens then?

Solo. Alone. No one to bounce ideas off of. No one to share in defining
strategy. No one to lean on, or hold you accountable. No one to review your work.
No one to tell you when something is a bad idea.

It's lonely. The experience of trying to build [Shubox](https://shubox.io) has
been lonely. If I could go back and change something, I wouldn't have gone down
this road without a partner, and will most likely never do that again<sup>[<a
href="#foot-2" name="source-2">2</a>]</sup>.

## Know Yourself

How well do you know yourself? I mean, *really know yourself*? Have you done
the work to inspect the depths of your strenghts and weaknesses? I find
self-awareness to be an incredibly underrated trait. What are your flaws? Are
you clear on what motivates you? What discourages you? What you're terrified
of, but would never in a million years admit to? You may not be familiar with
these unknown unknowns *yet* , but putting yourself through the process of
starting and running a business will surface these, over time, almost
certainly.

For example, I now know I have a distaste for marketing *me*, putting myself
"out there". I am modest to a fault and would much rather play hype-man for
friends, and colleagues. Building in the open? Why would anyone care? I'm just
some random guy!

I also know I'd rather work on "this technical thing", than pour effort and
cycles into the marketing, promotion, selling. It's so much easier to be neck
deep in code building something.

And - this one's tough - do you know you can never *really fail* if you don't
*really try*? Not gonna lie, this one hurts. It's taken me a long time to
confront this in particular. There's a voice in the depths of the back of my
brain, haunting me: "If I don't allow this get big, then will I ever truly
*fail*?" It's a process to recognize and confront those voices, one truth at a
time.

## Accountability

As mentioned previously, the lack of accountability remains one of
the more profoundly affecting missing pieces of the puzzle. When there's no one
to report to, where do you go? Who is there to keep you honest? Over the years
upon reflection, the biggest challenges I've managed to overcome had
accountability as a central tenant, providing me a ballast to keep my
ship upright, to stay on course. If you are accountable to no one, then you *are
accountable to no one*. Find that person, those people, even if they don't
really care! Email them! Say "I'm going to do this", then follow up. If you
do not accomplish what you set out to do, be honest, be vulnerable, know
yourself, and truly know *why* you did or did not do what you said you would.

## Finally

This post has been living in my head for months while I work through how I'm
moving forward. My publishing this, in and of itself, is a large part of the
process where I come to grips with those fears, uncertainties, hard truths,
while allowing myself to feel uncomfortable. I am at peace knowing that failure
isn't truly _failure_ if I've set out on that journey, did my best, learned
something, and can look back with no regrets.

So, here we are!

Stay tuned.

More to come.
