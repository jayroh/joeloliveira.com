These photos were taken one afternoon when I went to take the little Chubbster out to the courtyard. I ran into our neighbor [Andrew][4] as he was out their with his super-duper high-tech Nikon DSLR. Edie went nuts and the photos above are the result. A huge thanks to Andrew and an equally large thanks to the dog for being such a photogenic weirdo.
