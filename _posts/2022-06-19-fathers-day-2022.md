After finishing a recent book -- [Mouth to Mouth](https://www.amazon.com/Mouth-Novel-Antoine-Wilson-ebook/dp/B0984QR6JH/ref=sr_1_1) (verdict: "meh. ⭐⭐") -- I picked up
Michael Ian Black's "[A Better Man: A (Mostly Serious) Letter to My Son](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Man-Letter-My-Son/dp/1616209119)" and dived in. I figured, hey it's
almost Father's Day, so let's see what this funny guy has to say. And as the title of the book says, yes - this really is a mostly serious piece of writing. He gets
into the heavy stuff pretty quickly.

But that's not why I'm writing this. There's a bit in the first 10 or 20 pages where he explores the feeling of when he crossed into the realm of "manhood":

> Before I sat down to write this, I couldn’t have told you the moment I felt I’d crossed, irrevocably, into manhood.
>
> ...
>
> It was when I drove my family home from the hospital for the first time.
>
> ...
>
> I’ve never been more terrified than the moment I turned out of the parking lot.

This statement stopped me, and I let out a quiet, "heh", chuckle.

Because this has been, almost _verbatim_, what I have shared with first-time
parents through the past 7+ years that I've been a father. "No one prepares you for
the moment you strap your child in that car-seat, and drive away. There was
'you before', and 'you now', there is no manual, so go figure it out."

Happy Father's day to all you Dads out there. I trust, and hope, that you are
navigating those waters successfully. ❤️
