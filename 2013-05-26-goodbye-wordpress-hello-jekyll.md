Hello [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).

I'm behind the curve and moving my old neglected website to my new neglected website -- heh, hopefully not -- has, for a long while, been on the list of things to get to. The reasons why are too many to count, but at the core is that the wordpress experience is a terrible chore.
